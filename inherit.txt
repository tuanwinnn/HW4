Code Reusability and Reducing Redundancy

Inheritance lets you define common attributes and methods once in a parent class, 
then reuse them across multiple child classes without duplicating code.

Establishing Relationships and Polymorphism

Inheritance models real-world "is-a" relationships and allows different objects to be treated uniformly 
through a common interface while maintaining their specific behaviors.
